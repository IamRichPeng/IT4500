//  This file is for pairing created assignments by this app to the EKEvent collection
//      in order to shuffle or assign time slots for assignments that do not have a
//      static start time/date.

//      -Title
//      -Duration
//      -Due Date
//      -Start Date(NULL IF NOT ALREADY ASSIGNED)

//need to find a time slot to place new assignment, must be before due date OTHERWISE reshuffle all assignments

//need to keep track of assignments we create
